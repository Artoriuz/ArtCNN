# ArtCNN_C4F16_Soft
Same as the normal C4F16 but trained to look a bit softer. This is also a denoise model.

# ArtCNN_C4F16_Softer
Same as above but even softer.

# ArtCNN_C4F32_EXP_CMP
Same as the normal C4F32 but trained with various degradation models at the same time. This model is capable of dealing with source ringing/blur.

# ArtCNN_C4F32_EXP2_CMP
Same as above but without sharpening capabilities. It simply deals with source ringing.
